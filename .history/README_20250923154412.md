# Assignment 3 - Handling events

Instructions
In this Lab assignment, you will update your Book Catalog app as follows:

-   Create a new project folder
-   Copy the code from the previous assignment
-   Implement the following functionalities:
    -   make the "add" button active such that when clicked, it opens a modal dialog containing a form for creating a new book. The form should have at a minimum the following fields: title, author, publisher, publication year, language, pages
    -   submitting the form should close the modal dialog, but otherwise does nothing for the time being
    -   update the book component as follows:
        -   add a remove button which, when clicked, removes the book from the page
        -   there should be a visual indicator (prominent border, changing background) when a book is clicked upon to signify a book being selected. Clicking on a "selected" book should restore the original visuals.

Here is a live example: https://yveshema.github.io/comp3170-book-catalog-v3/
