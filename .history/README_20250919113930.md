# Assignment 2 - Rendering lists

COMP 3170 - Frontend Web Development
BCIT - Digital Design and Development

---

Instructions
Create a React app for displaying a list of books provided as an external import. This is a continuation of the previous assignment, but should be completed as a separate project:

-   Create a new project folder
-   Copy the code from the previous assignment
-   Create a folder named "data" at the root of your project. Download the attached "books.json" file and place it in this folder.
-   Somewhere in your code, import the data from "books.json" and use it to render a list of Book components - You can import data from a JSON file like so:
    import data from '/path/to/json/data';

The "add" button and the list of books should be displayed in a grid, such that the "add" button sits in its own column while everything remain perfectly align horizontally and vertically.
Modify the Book component so that it displays the book's price instead of the author.

Here is a live example: https://yveshema.github.io/comp3170-book-catalog-v2/

Submission
Deploy your app to Vercel or Github Pages and submit the link to the Lab assignment: Rendering lists assignment folder.
